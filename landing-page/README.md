# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

I started my project and i'll add what i passed

I started to loop for section and added a Nav item for each section

then I added scrollIntoView method to scroll smothly to the section

I used documentFragment to make app performance better and to reduce repaint and reflow

working with getBoundingClientRect() with a little confusing to me it worked but still static, values doesn't change with scrolling and I couldn't solve this problem for sorry.


Thank you
